I am a graduating senior at **The Ohio State University** pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science (AI track) and Linguistics (Computational Linguistics track).

My research focuses on **computational linguistics** and **syntax**. Specifically, I am interested in how humans acquire grammatical knowledge from limited input and how we can mathematically characterize this process using computational models.

I am currently applying to PhD programs in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics for Fall 2026 admission.

### Research Interests

* **Neural Grammar Induction:** Investigating how neural networks (like RNNs and Transformers) learn hierarchical structures.
* **Syntax-Semantics Interface:** Understanding how structural representations interact with meaning.
* **Machine Translation:** Evaluating cultural adaptation and fidelity in Large Language Models.

### Recent Projects

* **Cross-Cultural Evaluation of LLMs:** Designed a benchmark to test how GPT-5 and Llama-3.1 handle culturally specific movie title translations.
* **Emergent Strategy in Wordle:** Built a Reinforcement Learning agent that learned expert-level strategies (like trap-set analysis) without explicit instruction.
* **Neural Grammar Induction:** Analyzed how Recurrent Neural Networks process the Dyck language to approximate unbounded hierarchical dependencies.
