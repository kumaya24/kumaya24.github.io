# Jacqui Wang 

I am a graduating senior at **The Ohio State University** pursuing a dual degree in Computer and Information Science (AI track) and Linguistics (Computational Linguistics track).

My research interests center on **computational linguistics** and **syntax**. Specifically, I am interested in how humans acquire grammatical knowledge from limited input and how this process can be formally characterized using computational modeling.

I am currently applying to PhD programs in **Linguistics** and **Computer Science** for Fall 2026 admission.

### Research Focus

* **Neural Grammar Induction:** Investigating how neural networks learn hierarchical structures and unbounded dependencies.
* **Syntax-Semantics Interface:** Understanding how structural representations interact with meaning.
* **Cross-Cultural NLP:** Evaluating cultural adaptation and fidelity in Large Language Models.

### Recent Updates

* **Feb 2026:** Submitting a paper on *Cross-Cultural Evaluation of LLMs* (Title Translation).
* **Dec 2025:** Finalized experimental design for *Emergent Strategy in Wordle* using Reinforcement Learning under [Prof. Michael White](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/white.1240).
* **Current:** Working as a Research Assistant on neural grammar induction under [Prof. William Schuler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/schuler.77).

### Personal Interests
Outside of research, I serve as the President of the [**OSU Kendo Club**](https://www.instagram.com/osukendo.official/), where I manage training and operations for the team. I also enjoy **hiking**, **baking**, **knitting** (ask me about my latest project!) and learning Japanese language via natural acquisition.
