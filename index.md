[cite_start]I am a graduating senior at **The Ohio State University** pursuing a dual degree in Computer and Information Science (AI track) and Linguistics (Computational Linguistics track)[cite: 8].

My research interests center on **computational linguistics** and **syntax**. [cite_start]Specifically, I am interested in how humans acquire grammatical knowledge from limited input and how this process can be formally characterized using computational modeling[cite: 5, 55].

[cite_start]I am currently applying to PhD programs in Linguistics and Computational Linguistics for Fall 2026 admission[cite: 58].

### Research Focus

* [cite_start]**Neural Grammar Induction:** Investigating how neural networks (like RNNs and Transformers) learn hierarchical structures and unbounded dependencies[cite: 14, 15, 69].
* [cite_start]**Syntax-Semantics Interface:** Understanding how structural representations (like those in the Dyck language) interact with meaning[cite: 5, 15].
* [cite_start]**Cross-Cultural NLP:** Evaluating cultural adaptation and fidelity in Large Language Models, specifically for complex translation tasks[cite: 27, 209].

### Recent Updates

* [cite_start]**Feb 2025:** Submitting a paper on *Cross-Cultural Evaluation of LLMs* (Title Translation)[cite: 112].
* [cite_start]**Dec 2025:** Completed a project on *Emergent Strategy in Wordle* using Reinforcement Learning under Dr. Michael White[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Current:** Working as a Research Assistant in the Schuler Lab on neural grammar induction[cite: 10, 11].
