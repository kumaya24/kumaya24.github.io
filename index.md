I am a graduating senior at The Ohio State University pursuing a dual degree in Computer and Information Science (AI track) and Linguistics (Computational Linguistics track).

My research interests center on **computational linguistics** and **syntax**. Specifically, I am interested in how humans acquire grammatical knowledge from limited input and how this process can be formally captured by computational modeling.

I am currently applying to PhD programs in Linguistics for Fall 2026 admission.
